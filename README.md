# Sam-Sounds-Replacer
A tool for non-modders to replace sounds of player weapons and enemies and some other things.

How to use it:

`Find the mod file: ...\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\564310\3521723926

`Copy zz3521723926.gro to somewhere else, rename it as zz3521723926.zip and extract it.

`Run SamSoundsReplacer.exe, and choose the disk where Sam2017 game is installed in.

`Wait a few seconds for files to load, and it will show a list of sound files in Sam2017.

`You can single click a file to listen, and double click to find custom sound file to replace it.

`It will also show info of current sound file, like sample rate, bit depth and channel counts. Better to let your custom sound file have the same value as original sound file, or the game might fail to play it.

`This app needs .net framework 4.8 to run. Normally Windows systems all have this by default, unless old ones such as WinXP.
